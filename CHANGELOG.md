## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Bumped `flate2` to `1.1` (enabled `zlib-rs` feature)
- Bumped `bevy` to `0.17.0`
- Reworked `HpakWriter` into a builder-style API
- Use a memory-mapped slice reader for archive entries
- Updated default per-extension compression mapping and added `set_default_extension_compression_methods` to populate sensible defaults for common file extensions
- Writer defaults: metadata minification enabled and entry alignment defaults to 4096 bytes, entries are deterministically sorted when packing directories
- Improved `HpakReader` performance

### Added

- `HpakWriter::add_paths_from_dir`

### Fixed

- RON minifier now preserves escape sequences (e.g. `\\t`) inside strings instead of unescaping them
- Properly handle partial initialization in array `Decode` impl to avoid unsafe indexing and clippy warnings
- Entries' path now uses XXH3 ensuring hash stability

- Removed `pack_assets_folder` convenience function in favor of the `HpakWriter` API
- Removed the `deflate` feature flag and many unused `Encode`/`Decode` impls

### Changed
